Description:
Soundstage is wide with the balance of bass and treble, and vocals being whole, due to dialogue enhancer, and, sibilant due to smarttreble freq modification, and bass being fairly boosted yet punchy. Does also aim to bring most of the details of the song while expanding and making the sound crispier.
